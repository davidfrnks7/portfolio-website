    "I have been interested in tech for as long as I remember. In high school I managed my own CMS powered website and game servers. In high school I was in the AOIT club where we salvaged old hardware from campus to repair and repurpose and help assist teachers with tech related needs when the IT department was overwhelmed with service tickets.",
    "As a New Orleans native I love to cook and it is one of my many hobbies when I am not working on code and tech challenges. I also love to play video games, go biking, and write stories.",
    "My career goal is to get into CyberSecurity or DevSecOps. My dream is to find a way to make consumer grade IoT and networking devices more secure by default with little to no configuration. It's been a dream of mine ever since I started seeing stories about baby monitors being hacked into. We shouldn't have to live in a world where that is easy or common.",
    "When building and developing my code I always have my late, quadriplegic uncle in my mind. Would he have issues navigating this? Would he be able to do this unassisted or with his assistive devices? Being surrounded by disabled people half of my life I have seen the ways in which they struggle. I strive to push the internet to being a more accessible place for the disabled. With or without assistive devices."

    "I am a mid-level Full Stack Software Engineer. I take pride in my attention to detail, focus on accessibility, and desire to grow.",
    "I have knowledge and background in system, network, and database administration, PEGA, DevOps, managing and creating external correspondence, adhering to client design artifacts and mockups, adhering to web accessibility compliance standards.",
    "My passion for software development is driven by the fact that there is no one way to solve a problem that is presented. There are seemingly infinite ways to experiment and try new things. I especially find joy in trying to optimize my old code and upgrading it with new tech and features.",
    "I am capable of learning very quickly and have proved that by attending and graduating a 6 month, 1000+ hour coding bootcamp. These skills have carried over into my career as I have been able to effortlessly learn and adapt to new and ever evolving languages, platforms, and softwares I use on a day to day basis. I have also been able to easily adapt to the needs of my team and the clients' needs when it comes to introducing new technologies, softwares, frameworks, coding languages, or to cross-train to aid my colleagues with their tasks and needs.",
    "I am often taking on some kind of tech challenge. Whether that is deploying new services to my homelab, toying around with a new website idea, or catching up on the latest tech news and figuring out if I could implement it in my past or future projects."
